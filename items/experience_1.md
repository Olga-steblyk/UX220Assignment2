## Committing to University
<hr />

**1. What was it that you did?**
<br />
When I was in gr12, I was seconding guessing my choice into going to university. All my friends in high school were going into universities that are from my hometown of 'Toronto', such as TMU, UofT, OCAD or York, but I was going to Brantford. In addition, I was unsure of what I wanted to do in my future, as I love art and photography, I knew it is more realistic to go to a more STEM focused such as computer science. 

**2. When did you do it?** 
<br />
This took place in my Gr.12 year, I made my choice to commit to university in a Starbuck with my sister, around March. 

**3. What was good about it?**
Few things that stand out to me, would be that I am happy that I have more structure and vision on what I want to do in the future and how my can look to be. I am now considering going into grad school for a master in information with a specialization in UX in Toronto. I see my self doing this job in the future and still enjoying doing.

**4. What was your favourite memory of it?:** 
<br />
One of my most favourite memories would be with my friends, meeting them and spending time with them. Some of them I met through my residence building, in class or just around Brantford. With out them, my experience would not be the same. From just going to a grocery store to celebrating my birthday, I love my friends. 

**5. What didn't you enjoy about it?:**
<br />
One thing I did not enjoy in university is realizing that I am an adult with adult responsibilities. It is very expensive living as a student on my own, and learning how to manage time, money, but also personal well being. 

**6. Give your experience a letter "grade":**
I would give this experience a letter: B for the most part enjoyable.
