## Driving
<hr />

**1. What was it that you did?**
<br />
What I did was getting my drivers license, G2 to be specific. Driving has always something I was hesitant to get into, as I always has a fear of it, driving cars specifically, as I do have a motorcycle license. 

**2. When did you do it?** 
<br />
At the start of the academic year, so at the beginning of fall term this year I got my G2. But before that, I was practicing driving with my dad in the summer. It was very difficult for me, as I did not like driving at the start very much but I had warmed up to it with practice and training.

**3. What was good about it?**
<br />
I like driving as in I have more freedom where to go any time, such as in I do not have to strongly rely on public transport, when it rains or any issue in regards to that.

**4. What was your favourite memory of it?**
<br />
My most favourite memory would be driving somewhere spontaneous. When looking for places to celebrate my birthday, we saw that Paris was very close to brantford, but what we also how near it really is. Since it was near 12am, the traffic was non-existent at the point and the trip would take less than 15 mins. So on a last minute decisions, we drove to Paris Ontario.

**5. What didn't you enjoy about it?**
<br />
At times, I feel that it can get stressful, as there are many responsibilities that come with it and it can be very stressful. Driving in unexpected conditions such as snow can lead to dangerous situation.  

**6. Give your experience a letter "grade"**
<br />
I would give this experience a letter: **C** It was ok
