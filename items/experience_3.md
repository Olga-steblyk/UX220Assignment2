## Sputnik Volunteer
<hr />

**1. What was it that you did?**
<br />
I volunteer as a photographer and graphic designer for the brantford student led newspaper, often times, you can see my names under photos I have taken. 

**2. When did you do it?** 
I started in my second term as a first year, but I made my decision before that. I was looking some place that I can volunteer and use my camera knowledge for good. 
**3. What was good about it?** 
<br />
As a person who deeply cares about art, I like being able to create something, either for an article or something small. I am also able to serve my community, even with something small. 

**4. What was your favourite memory of it?** 
<br />
One of my favourite memories of it would be, getting creative with photos. Sometimes there are limitation to what the writers want, but sometimes they are free and usually down for anything. I am able to explore and do my own research on the topic about what the writers are trying to say. 

**5. What didn't you enjoy about it?**
<br />
There are a few parts in which it can be stressful. Such as getting photos in time for the deadline or trying to understand what the writers are trying to say with their writing.  

**6. Give your experience a letter "grade"**
<br />
I would give this experience a letter: B for the most part enjoyable.
