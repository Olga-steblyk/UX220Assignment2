## O-Week Ice Breaker


**1. What was it that you did?** 
<br />
I Volunteered as an icebreaker this year and I had a blast. I was helping first years with questions about university and just general ways on univeristy life.

**2. When did you do it?** 
<br />
I did it at the start of the academic year, in early september.  

**3. What was good about it?**
<br />
I enjoyed the friends I made, both on my team and the first years, it was nice to meet people from my home town. I had fun at the events such as a hypnotist show, drag show and Wayne Hoffman. 

**4. What was your favourite memory of it?**
<br />
One of my most memorable moment would probably be, the closing ceremonies in which the team did not have to wear the yellow shirts but instead something nice. 

**5. What didn't you enjoy about it?**
<br />
Since it is a volunteer position, I did not get paid for long hours in the sun. After a while, a sense of hysteria sets in, so that everything is fun

**6. Give your experience a letter "grade"**
<br />
I would give this experience a letter: B for the most part enjoyable
